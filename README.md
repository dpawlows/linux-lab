# Linux Home Lab

A repository for documenting my home Linux lab, built on **Pop!_OS** using **KVM/libvirt** VMs. Here, I practice Linux admin, automation with Ansible, and system hardening.

## Structure
| Folder | Goal |
|--------|-------|
| `01-core-infra/` | VM creation, networking and SSH config |
| `02-services/` | Web, mail, databases, and monitoring services |
| `03-automation/` | Ansible playbooks and config |
| `04-secuirt/ ` | Auditing, hardening, and backup procedures |
| `docs/` | Diagrams and reference notes |

## Progress!
- [ ] Configure KVM + bridge networking
- [ ] Create first VM
- [ ] Enable SSH key access 
- [ ] Install Ansible
- [ ] Automate first config

## Documentation Rules
Whenever I complete a step, I’ll create or update a Markdown file describing:
- **What** I did, including commands, config snippets, etc.
- **Why** I did it, including any trade-offs.
- **Verification** with tests, screenshots, or sample output.

Each major milestone will get a short "_What I learned_” summary.
